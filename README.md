# Undercover Numbers: Infiltration Protocol (UNIP)

## How the Game Works
There are 5 levels, ranging from 1 (the easiest) to 5 (the most challenging).

### Instructions with Example: 

1. There are 3 numbers in the code.
   - This means you must enter three numbers.
  
2. The codes add up to 3.
   - The sum of the three numbers you enter should be 3.

3. The codes multiply to give 1.
   - The product of the three numbers you enter should be 1.

To solve this level 1, you need to find three numbers that meet both conditions. <br>
In this case, the numbers are 1, 1, and 1 because:

- 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (sum condition) 
- 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 (product condition)

If you enter these numbers correctly, you should be able to proceed to the next level. 
If you get it wrong, you might receive a message indicating that you entered the wrong code and would need to try again.
